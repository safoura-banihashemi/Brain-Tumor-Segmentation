# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation

This project presents a deep learning-based pipeline for brain tumor segmentation using MRI scans. Leveraging a U-Net architecture, the model is trained to accurately detect tumor regions within brain images. The performance of the model is evaluated using Dice coefficient and loss metrics, ensuring reliable segmentation results.

The dataset contains 3D MRI images in NIfTI format (.nii.gz). Each patient record includes four MRI modalities and one segmentation mask:

T1: Native Scan

T1ce: Contrast-Enhanced T1 Scan

T2: T2-Weighted Scan

FLAIR: Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery Scan

Segmentation masks represent labeled regions as follows:

0: Background (no tumor)

1: Non-Enhancing Tumor Core

2: Peritumoral Edema (swelling around the tumor)

3: Missing label

4: Enhancing Tumor
